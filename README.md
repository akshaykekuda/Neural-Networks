# Neural-Networks
Implementation of the below Neural Network models:
1. Deisgned a MLP network to solve the 7 bit odd parity problem. Experimented with different learning rates, activation function and momentum
2. Implemented an RBF network for one input variable, one output variable and Gaussian basis functions. The Gaussian center was determined by k-means algorithm. 
3. Restricted Bolzmann Machine to learn a collaborative filter. Model training is done on people ice-cream preference custom dataset. Achieved an accuracy of 85%
